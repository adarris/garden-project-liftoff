### Overview
The Garden Planner web application idea came from my best friend, Sue Miller, who plans to feed their neighbors for free with a small community garden. They got a bit of a late start and does not know where to begin. They spent half their day trying to determine if tomatoes would grow best with jalapenos and the best area of their garden to grow broccoli that needs lots of shade. Our Garden Planner app is here for Sue, a novice, and even those with the greenest thumb. 
The mission of our Garden Planner app is to take the guess-work out of seeding and planting your crops. We have done the work of determining the best companion plants for Sue's tomatoes, determining their garden layout, access their gardening progress, find the best local flowers, and much more. Users will be allowed to create accounts to save preferences, gather information about companion planting, succession planting, heart their favorite perennials, and note the needs their plants have. 

Transform your space to a beatiful oasis using our Garden Planner app now via Google Play or Apple App Store.
  * Coming feature offers reminders to water, plant, and fertilize via email.
